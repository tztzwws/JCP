"These really do help you fall asleep. But I am having the most insane and very intense dreams. The dreams feel so real and I keep waking up due to the dreams. Every time I fall back asleep it's a different dream. For example I have a married to my husband for 21 years and the dream that I just currently had was about me being married to somebody else with three other children in my dream that I don't ever remember giving birth to. Then I woke up went back to sleep and had a completely different dream about my daughter living in some underground world almost like a cult that controls you. I was told when I went into the underground world that if I lost my ticket I would never get out. That dream ended with me and my daughter and my husband all drowning after I was in a modeling competition with my daughter. I think I may need to try to find something else because I'm not really getting sleep but I am falling asleep with unbelievable sometimes almost terrifying dreams. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I do fall asleep.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

It doesn't have a smell, and leaves a slight sticky feeling that quickly dries away. The spritzer is strong though, it's like taking a spray bottle to the face.

Using a partition program I discovered that the partition which was supposed to be for Win10 was not set up properly...Had to repartition the HD. Finally did get a correct Win10 installed.

I tried Apache first and it wasn't that good. Lots of issues with the word processing - the main program I use - so I uninstalled Apache and downloaded this suite - LibreOffice v4.3 for PC. AMAZING! Works just like Word in every way and you can open Libre documents in Word and vice versa. The suite is also compatible with Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. I was surprised to learn that a lot of companies use and support Libre Open Office suite as their regular suite. Think about how cost effective this is for everyone. I guess I won't be buying Microsoft Office again. Ever. With the word processing program, I can create documents for reviews and then paste them right into the review form on Amazon with no problem.

I realize all things change with time, but I'm disappointed with what now passes as Pumas. The materials are cheap and don't last long.

I did not return it because I have had in the back of my mind to buy a region free / multi region capable machine since before then but have not done that yet due in part to some of the videos that were only in region 2 turning up later in region 1. I just now saw this Fleetwood Mac - The Dance available at a decent price new and had it in my cart all ready to order it and . . . still no info on the region of this latest offering. WHERE IS THE ""REPORT INCORRECT PRODUCT INFORMATION "" BUTTON ? ? ? It seems to now be absent. (probably not enough staff to man it these days) AND P.S. : where is the ""Ask a question "" button ? ? ? Amazon : we could be easing your burden by getting the lackadaisical vendor (s) to fill in the blanks directly here.

If your someone with hormonal imbalances looking for a natural way to sleep I suggest a melatonin with botanicals and minerals in it to help aid sleep.

I chose not to use the included restraints that attach to the bath; neither of my dogs were scared by the new bathtub. The only problem, and this is with me, not the tub, is that I had to resist leaning on the frame; I doubt that it would have held my weight.

"I had first heard about powdered Gatorade back when I had COVID and needed to work extra hard at staying hydrated, but it took me a while to give in and try it. I chose this variety pack because I know I like all three of these flavors in the bottle and I just couldn't beat the price. Plus I need something to help me keep my electrolytes up. What I love about the powders is I can easily put the packets into a ziploc bag and carry that around with me to add to my water bottle whenever I want to, no matter where I am. And again, it saves me a lot of money. For the most part, the flavors are still pretty good, but you do get a slight chalky, powdery taste at first. (Hence why I didn't give it a perfect 5*s.) But once all of the powder dissolves, you don't notice it as much and it still beats plain water. Another bonus is this is the G2, so you don't have all of the added sugars that you get in regular Gatorade. I am curious about other flavors, but again, these are my three favorites.

"So, you get the watch as described. Has games, two cameras, takes photos and videos, and can play music, plus more. Battery life is also pretty good. But there are some issues: 1. Touch screen is slow which makes it difficult to navigate the user interface. And sometimes, it either stood working and strangely, it's hard to power off the watch in those moments as if the coffee that processes the touchscreen or button inputs is stuck. 2. I get why these have dedicated camera buttons but I think it's too easy to accidentally activate. Could be better to need a long press or two quick presses to activate. 3. After accumulating videos and photos, you might want to transfer some off the watch to your PC. Well, you can't. While it allows you to add music for play back, there's no way to access most files created on the watch. 4. I'm not sure if there's a good solution but the positioning of the cameras isn't that great for young children to frame photos.

"For my purposes, this watch works just fine. However, I have only had the watch a couple months and the band already broke. I am lucky I didn't lose the whole watch as a necessary piece to hold the band together fell off. I really got the watch to keep time, track my sleep, and track my steps. The BP and heart rate readings are off by quite a bit, but I do believe that might be true of many watches like this. From what I read, consistency of the readings is the key. Sleep tracking is fair; it often continues to add hours of sleep when I am already out of bed. I would suggest making sure you look at your sleep totals as soon as you get up. I like knowing how many hours of deep/light sleep I have had, but again, there have been times I have been awake during the night for hours and the watch included those times in the total as well. The watch is easy to charge and I love the ""find your phone"" feature. For the price, this watch has served its purpose.
