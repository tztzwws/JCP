Every time I fall back asleep it's a different dream. For example I have a married to my husband for 21 years and the dream that I just currently had was about me being married to somebody else with three other children in my dream that I don't ever remember giving birth to. Then I woke up went back to sleep and had a completely different dream about my daughter living in some underground world almost like a cult that controls you. I was told when I went into the underground world that if I lost my ticket I would never get out. That dream ended with me and my daughter and my husband all drowning after I was in a modeling competition with my daughter. I think I may need to try to find something else because I'm not really getting sleep but I am falling asleep with unbelievable sometimes almost terrifying dreams. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I do fall asleep.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

Works just like Word in every way and you can open Libre documents in Word and vice versa. The suite is also compatible with Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. I was surprised to learn that a lot of companies use and support Libre Open Office suite as their regular suite. Think about how cost effective this is for everyone. I guess I won't be buying Microsoft Office again. Ever. With the word processing program, I can create documents for reviews and then paste them right into the review form on Amazon with no problem.

I chose not to use the included restraints that attach to the bath; neither of my dogs were scared by the new bathtub. The only problem, and this is with me, not the tub, is that I had to resist leaning on the frame; I doubt that it would have held my weight.

"I had first heard about powdered Gatorade back when I had COVID and needed to work extra hard at staying hydrated, but it took me a while to give in and try it. I chose this variety pack because I know I like all three of these flavors in the bottle and I just couldn't beat the price. Plus I need something to help me keep my electrolytes up. What I love about the powders is I can easily put the packets into a ziploc bag and carry that around with me to add to my water bottle whenever I want to, no matter where I am. And again, it saves me a lot of money. For the most part, the flavors are still pretty good, but you do get a slight chalky, powdery taste at first. (Hence why I didn't give it a perfect 5*s.) But once all of the powder dissolves, you don't notice it as much and it still beats plain water. Another bonus is this is the G2, so you don't have all of the added sugars that you get in regular Gatorade. I am curious about other flavors, but again, these are my three favorites.

And sometimes, it either stood working and strangely, it's hard to power off the watch in those moments as if the coffee that processes the touchscreen or button inputs is stuck. 2. I get why these have dedicated camera buttons but I think it's too easy to accidentally activate. Could be better to need a long press or two quick presses to activate. 3. After accumulating videos and photos, you might want to transfer some off the watch to your PC. Well, you can't. While it allows you to add music for play back, there's no way to access most files created on the watch. 4. I'm not sure if there's a good solution but the positioning of the cameras isn't that great for young children to frame photos. To be fair, it seems they mostly don't care but there are times when it creates frustration.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

"For my purposes, this watch works just fine. However, I have only had the watch a couple months and the band already broke. I am lucky I didn't lose the whole watch as a necessary piece to hold the band together fell off. I really got the watch to keep time, track my sleep, and track my steps. The BP and heart rate readings are off by quite a bit, but I do believe that might be true of many watches like this. From what I read, consistency of the readings is the key. Sleep tracking is fair; it often continues to add hours of sleep when I am already out of bed. I would suggest making sure you look at your sleep totals as soon as you get up. I like knowing how many hours of deep/light sleep I have had, but again, there have been times I have been awake during the night for hours and the watch included those times in the total as well. The watch is easy to charge and I love the ""find your phone"" feature. For the price, this watch has served its purpose.

The best part of this set is a vividly colored 30x40Äù play-mat to spread on the floor or table. In my day this mat would have been a Cretaceous or Jurassic landscape with volcanoes & rock formations. But in a post-Spielberg era this set naturally offers an actual Dino themed park with rides, sideshows and paths, even a grand entrance arch! I got this for the Mrs to use in her Pre-k classroom but IÄôd recommend this to anybody who is looking for a classic ChildrenÄôs gift idea.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

"I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews on here! My son is 4 and we had so much fun doing all these experiments together. I followed them exactly for the plaster to set the volcano, no issues with it hardening first at all. My guess is some people didnÄôt mix things in the proper order? No idea. We made the mold, baked it in the oven on low and waited till the next day to paint it, painted it then waited till the next day for the eruptions.. the paint stayed on the whole time and now he has a fun painted volcano to keep playing with. We did the mixture that came with it, then added soap, then did baking soda and vinegar. He loved them all. The crystals turned out very similar to the picture, we placed them in a sunny window, kept it covered for the first 24 hours, and had great results. He loved the digging for the rocks and checking out the fact sheet to figure out which rocks are which. and The dueling tornados fascinated him too. If youÄôre having trouble getting the tornado going, simply start spinning the whole thing quickly counterclockwise. Worked like a charm. We added food coloring and that result was really cool too. I seriously donÄôt understand some of these reviews. A younger kid could not do these activities alone, but as a fun family project itÄôs great!

If you wear wide, consider going up a width, or two, as well. Toe box depth on both were shallow as well. Both pairs seemed like they returned before. Boxes were damaged, interior wrapping was torn up, and shoe laces had different knots. Returned for refund.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

"This product is amazing for its novelty with 'VR'. For new 1st time users it's as if the Big Bang characters had morphed into your room and were playing episodes of Star Trek. The idea or concept of fully immersive VR doesn't seem to have caught up with the hype. It is more like looking through your old viewfinder from 70 years ago. And most of the games available are wipe downs of the same killer games that have been around forever but now are seen through your view finder. It's too bad so many of the games are intended for the millennial crowd instead of applications in immersive VR for adults. And I feel like I am playing with my children's leggo sets for the avatars.

"There was a reason the book was popular and the powers that be who decided to adapt it into a film sucked all the charm right out of the story. To begin with, the characterization was all wrong. The Lucy character is supposed to be quirky. She is a people pleaser who allows people to take advantage of her because she's lonely (she lost her good friend when the companies merged). Josh's ""take no prisoners"" attitude is an anathema to her, but the filmmakers got the characters all wrong. In the film, Lucy is spunky, but all of her quirks are missing. She usually seems on the verge of having a tantrum and is very pouty most of the time. I'm sure this is meant to be cute, but really it's just boring and more than a little annoying. As far as Josh goes, his character suffers more. I'm sure Stowell is a lovely person, but his portrayal of Josh was all wrong. He is supposed to be a character that scares the bee-jeebers out of everyone. Stowell, frankly, is rather bland in the role. He's a big Ken doll. There's not much of a personality there. There is nothing intriguing about him. He's supposed to be the backbone of the company while Lucy is the soul, and for some reason, the directors thought it would work for Hale and Crowell to be cardboard cutouts,removing all the quirks and idiosyncrasies that made the characters entertaining. The Hating Game is hardly Tolstoy, but it is a fun story and the film adaptation takes all the fun out, seeming to think the audience isn't going to notice. The character names and the most basic parts of the story line were the same, but that was about it. Too many of the details of the story that made it work we're taken out rendering it extremely bland and lifeless. If an adaptation is going to be made, they should take the (little bit of) extra time to do it right so the story works.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

"I thought I was going to find a terrible movie from what I heard from social media and reviews. I find it quite alarming that a community of people who are fighting so hard for individuality cannot accept this film as one individual's experience no matter how ""right"" or ""wrong"" anything might be. One reviewer spoke about the controversy of holding down severely autistic people during a meltdown or otherwise. This is controversial, meaning for some it helps and others it doesn't, hence the polarization of controversy. None of us in the peanut gallery can speak blanketed ""shoulds"" over the rest of the world this way. No one died and made anyone God. Where is the love? But also, film is artistic. And no one has a right to tell other people their artistic view of anything is right or wrong. Art IS subjective, that's why it is art. Even if we could say that holding down autistic people is wrong 100%, that doesn't mean this ARTIST has not witnessed this in their world as a truth that some autistics experience this whether it is right or wrong. The world is losing it's mind to this megalomania like they know everything right for everyone else because their trauma makes this righteous. That is ridiculous. Do more research and open your hearts more. None of us can puff ourselves up and call ourselves gods through these blaming and shaming, canceling everybody out and shutting everyone's voices down hate. That is the very reason these movements started (for individuality and voice) and everyone participating in this cancel culture is crapping on their own beliefs and values. Wake up! This movie is awesome. Watch yourself. Stop parroting everyone and be more accepting and loving. Everyone deserves love and respect, just like the movie advocates. Your pride doesn't give you a right to hate on other people and cancel them out. It's just hate.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

I donÄôt understand why people were so upset over the ÄúrestrainingÄù. It didnÄôt seem like restraining, it was a way of holding her to let her know she was safe and loved. It also prevented her from hurting herself. I think of it like a weighted blanket that is soothing. Everyone is different and that includes autistic individuals. What might work best for one person may not work at all for someone else. The technique of holding Music tightly worked for her. Sia did an amazing job. The all star cast was perfect and of course the music was excellent in typical Sia fashion.

I believe this feedback should be disregarded. While not an expert on watches by any stretch, I consider myself an educated consumer. I understand the mechanism in the watch is well-regarded and commonly found in more expensive watches. While it is nearly identical to the submariner, it is clearly not going to pass for one under even superficial inspection, despite the automatic movement (which is smooth, but not smoothest IÄôve seen.)

The plating is immaculate, is easily sizable, and the quartz version keeps pinpoint time and in the mechanical version (automatic) it's well within the tolerance of the company which is about ¬± 20 seconds a day. It actually will do much better than that. It has striking good looks, is eminently dependable both in performance and put together, and in the end (to which we all, Äì Äì I'm laughing) when it needs work done as in the case of the automatic it surely will, to charge the watchmaker lays on you will certainly be at least the purchase price of the watch, so you can simply throw it away and buy a new one. And get the same quality I have just outlined. I sold diamonds, fine jewelry, and find watches for many years. As far as I'm concerned, this timepiece is worth far more than the asking price, and as someone who knows more than just a little bit about watches I do not hesitate to recommend it.

"First, I know reviews should be taken with a grain of salt but for those who complain about this device not using 5GHz, most IoT (plugs, bulbs, switches...etc) ONLY use 2.4GHz. Of many other reasons, it's because 2.4Ghz has a much longer range. It doesn't have as high of bandwidth capabilities but IoT devices obviously need very little bandwidth. Another downside to 2.4GHz is interference but longer range is more of a requirement than interference. I saw other complaints about not being able to schedule the plug via time of day. I don't know about the GE app but I'm not sure why you wouldn't use Google Home (might be others.) You can easily configure ""Routines"" and be much more detailed, if desired, than just time of day. This plug does support this through the Google Home app. The setup took me no longer than 2 minutes. I currently have it plugged into a space heater to test the max amperage abilities. I knocked off one star for two reasons. I couldn't find anywhere in the specs stating the max AMP capabilities. I bought this to control a pool pump which, while only rated at 10A, when it turns on and off it could spike higher than 10A and would fry any plug rated at 10A max. Since it's winter, I can't comment on this since space heaters do not have pumps which are what spikes the amperage. Lastly, the marketing is also a little misleading. I assumed I'd be able to control both plugs as if they were separate via wireless. That is not the case. Wirelessly you can turn the power on and off to both plugs but not individually. I guess how they are advertising it is you can physically turn each plug on and off because there is a button on the device. I was hoping to control each plug individually through routines and as desired from the Google Home app.",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

"Intro As a college student, having a reliable and portable workstation is extremely valuable. The New MacBook Air powered by the M1 chip is one of the most exciting devices recently released by Apple. Although it looks just like the previous models, the M1 chip delivers insanely great performance. Design and build Since its inception, Macbook AirÄôs design and build were one of its core selling points, and the Macbook Air M1 is no exception. It has that Signature Aluminium body that youÄôll see with the other Macbook Variants. The laptop not only looks premium but it definitely feels like your moneyÄôs worth. You can easily open this laptop with only one finger, this is possible because of the incredibly engineered hinge design done by apple. One of the things that the original Macbook air lacked for a while was a decent display, gone are the days of a 720p panel. And brought is a beautiful P3 Wide color gamut 2560*1440p panel, The overall viewing experience is awesome! The bezels are the same size as last year's model, which was kinda disappointing when compared to other laptops recently released, but it's not something that will ruin the overall viewing experience. The updated magic keyboard has better travel and also the gigantic mouse pad is always a blessing, IÄôm yet to find a trackpad on a laptop that I like better than the ones made by apple. The dual speaker grills on this laptop produce pretty decent sound, however, there is some slight distortion at high volumes. Storage Storage is also very important as a college student. As you're going to need some space to store all your documents, files, and Zoom Lectures. The MacBook Air comes with up to 2TB of SSD storage. This specific model I have only had 128GB of storage which honestly should be fine for most students, and if you donÄôt want to spend a lot of money you can always buy an external SSD or hard drive. This will cost you way less than what Apple offers. Portability As a College student in 2021, because of Covid, it's been kinda different, (Very small pause)all of our classes nowadays are held on zoom or some other online platform. So if you wanna use this laptop outside of a typical campus setting, then portability starts to matter. The MacBook Air weighs in at 2.75 pounds and is 15.6mm thick. This laptop will easily fit in most backups without feeling a noticeable weight difference. This is important to a lot of students, especially if you have back-to-back classes keeping in mind the average textbook weighs just over 4.6 pounds. This Laptop also easily fits in most handbags for women who were wondering. Reliability and Battery The Apple MacBook Air has proven itself as one of the most reliable laptops for a student this past decade. The Macbook Air is going to be a more compelling laptop for the students this, because of its insanely reliable performance for its price, but let's talk about the chip thatÄôs made all this possible. The biggest change this year is no doubt the M1 chip, the ARM-based chip is fast, like stupid fast. Applications open up real quick and the performance is consistently reliable. Not only can it easily fly through day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and typing research papers, but it can also handle intensive tasks such as 4K video editing, in fact, I managed to edit an entire 4K video on the M1 MacBook air and the performance & exporting times were very impressive. Anyway, that was sometimes impossible on the previous-gens of Macbook air. Now if you are considering this device for video editing then I would highly recommend the 16 Gig variant. The next best thing aside from its insane performance is the incredible battery life, I think this is the best battery life I have ever seen on a laptop of this form factor. The laptop lasted me multiple days of light usage with the usual workload being typing, browsing, and streaming content. I can pull a full day of heavy usage with tasks like editing photos and videos. Conclusion Overall thereÄôs a quote that says, ÄúSpeed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong directionÄù. (Mahatma Gandhi). The Macbook Air M1 has set a new benchmark for consistent performance and delivers insanely awesome battery life which makes the overall experience pretty fire. Its Portability, reliability, and speed not only make this a great investment for a student but also for anybody whoÄôs always on the go, and IÄôm personally really excited for the direction that Apple is heading towards with their new M lineup of processers.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1

They fit perfect, look good, have arch support, and are comfortable out of the box. The biggest reason i bought the Ecco shoes is because their TPU soles are supposed to outlast rubber sole shoes.
